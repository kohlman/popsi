# Data Sharing, Privacy and Consent

## Informed Consent

According to the [Declaration of 
Helsinki](https://www.wma.net/policies-post/wma-declaration-of-helsinki-ethical-principles-for-medical-research-involving-human-subjects/),

>**§32** For medical research using identifiable human material or data, such as
>research on material or data contained in biobanks or similar 
>repositories, physicians must seek informed consent for its collection,
>storage and/or reuse. There may be exceptional situations where consent would 
>be impossible or impracticable to obtain for such research. In such situations
>the research may be done only after consideration and approval of a 
>research ethics committee.

Most recent EU laws also suggest a strong emphasis on informed consent, although [Hesse state 
laws](https://datenschutz.hessen.de/pressemitteilungen/gesetz-zur-anpassung-des-hessischen-datenschutzrechts)
grant much more freedom to academic research.

Inspired by the [Ultimate Consent Forms](https://open-brain-consent.readthedocs.io/en/master/ultimate.html),
we have developed a general consent form hopefully sufficient to cover most investigations relevant to
conducting psychological and neurocognitive experiments.

## Appropriate Formats

A [guide for sharing data](https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing) by Jeff Leek's group
gives a detailed overview for data sharing best practices.

However, for neuroimaging or other complex data, consider the 
[BIDS](http://bids.neuroimaging.io) format.
